### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David Kroll, a full-stack web developer who has experience with the **PERN**/**MERN** stack. I have knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL, Python, and Google Apps Script. 

#### I'm looking for a back-end engineering role.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
- A project I call 'simple stocks', using real-time data from [IEXCloud](https://iexcloud.io/documentation/using-core-data/getting-real-time-core-financial-data.html) and financial datasets from [Sharadar](https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/SF1/documentation)
  - a web app where users can look up stock tickers and see... 
    - interactive charts
    - full financial statements for the past 5 years
    - financial analysis 
    - technical indicators
    - social data for each ticker. 
  - The goal is to build an informative, interactive, and complete website for financial analysis that's analagous to any brokerage's *Research* pages, with my own twist on financial metadata


âš¡ Fun facts: 
- I played college football
- I used to work in tax in the public accounting industry
- I read a lot of 80s sci fi
